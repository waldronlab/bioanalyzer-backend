## 📊 The 6 Essential BugSigDB Fields

The system analyzes papers for these critical fields:

1. **🧬 Host Species**: The organism being studied (Human, Mouse, Rat, etc.)
2. **📍 Body Site**: Sample collection location (Gut, Oral, Skin, etc.)
3. **🏥 Condition**: Disease/treatment/exposure being studied
4. **🔬 Sequencing Type**: Molecular method used (16S, metagenomics, etc.)
5. **🌳 Taxa Level**: Taxonomic level analyzed (phylum, genus, species, etc.)
6. **👥 Sample Size**: Number of samples or participants

## 🔧 Technical Improvements
